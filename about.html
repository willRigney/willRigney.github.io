<p>This is a project for the Bright Spark 2022 Invention Challenge about sustainability. We are 3 students from Peak to Peak Charter School in Colorado that care about the enviroment and wanted to make a change. Our idea for a stustanavility invention is for this app to be a reason for people to take buses and other public transportations more to reduce the amount of cars on the road, lowering carbon emissions. We have create a points system that will be added to whenever the user takes a form of public transportation. There are leaderboards to provided healthy competition to motivate people to take more methods of public transportation.</p>
